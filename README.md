# Flix


The Flix app uses [Movie data base api](https://themoviedb.docs.apiary.io/#) and [Youtube api](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to get the list of current movies in theatres. The app implemented the list of movies as well as there rating, description,release date and even a trailer of the movie from youtube!

### Notes
Challenges:

Although I had a fair share of bugs while making this app, specifically implementing trailers from youtube, creating this app was a great way to learn the basics of Android Development and API! 

### Open-source libraries implemented

- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids
- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
